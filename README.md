# Face-Recognition-Project
Recognise Faces using some classification algorithm - like Logistic, KNN, SVM etc.


 1. load the training data (numpy arrays of all the persons)
		 x- values are stored in the numpy arrays
		 y-values we need to assign for each person
 2. Read a video stream using opencv
 3. extract faces out of it
 4. use knn to find the prediction of face (int)
 5. map the predicted id to name of the user 
 6. Display the predictions on the screen - bounding box and name
